this branch is just here for serving up the intallers in an accessible way.
It was shamelessly stolen from BeakerBrowser <3

```bash
$ node build.js 0.1.1
```

```bash
$ npm run serve
# serve a local version for development
```

Commit changes then push
Push the `gh-pages` branch to github.com/protozoa-nz/whakakpapa-ora
